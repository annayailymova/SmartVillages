    "Description": "This map shows the number of hotels within a 10-kilometer radius, based on data sourced from OpenStreetMap as of 2023.<br><br>As expected, cities with large populations or tourist attractions have a high concentration of hotels, while rural areas typically do not. Aside from regional centers, coastal areas in Odesa region and Crimea have a high density of hotels due to their status as traditional resort regions."
