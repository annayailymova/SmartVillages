    "Description": "This map shows the number of kindergartens within a 10-kilometer radius, based on data sourced from OpenStreetMap as of 2023.<br><br>It is clear that kindergartens are mostly concentrated in urban areas and are underrepresented in rural regions. This is likely due to population differences between cities and villages. As a result, the highest concentration of kindergartens can be found in regional centers and large cities."
