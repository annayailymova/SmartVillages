    "Description": "This map shows the number of parks within a 10-kilometer radius, based on data sourced from OpenStreetMap as of 2023.<br><br>The map reveals that parks are less common in the southern regions of Ukraine. Furthermore, regional centers do not necessarily have a higher concentration of parks compared to other cities. Exceptions include Lviv, Cherkasy, Odesa, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Poltava, and Chernihiv. Notably, Kamianets-Podilskyi has the highest park density in Ukraine."
